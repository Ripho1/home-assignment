client side -

  image sizing in view posts?
  
  using the "sx" as to not use "important" in css files

  Error handlign in client side - the get compoents always get an array, in reality there should be a popup message indicating a failure

  in general if the operation to the server was a success i do not refetch the data but update the state according to already given info

  having App handle posteditor for both new and exisitng would mean App.tsx has to know exactly where each click happened and i dont like it

  app would be better would i have had a proper state manager
